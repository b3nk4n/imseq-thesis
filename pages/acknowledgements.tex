I would like to express my thank to those who offered feedback on the content or made this thesis possible. Starting with Prof. Dr. Daniel Cremers for his valuable suggestions at the beginning of my work. Also my advisor Philip HÃ¤usser for offering this interesting topic, his continuous support as well as our fruitful discussion at Google Zurich. Furthermore, I would like to acknowledge PD Dr. habil. Rudolph Triebel for his tough but outstanding lecture \textit{Machine Learning in Computer Vision} at TUM, which initiated my interest to do a thesis in this field.


Last but not least, I would also like to thank my family for their faith and positive mentality, who waited patiently for me to finish this work. And not forgetting Firstname1 Lastname1, Firstname2 Lastname2 and Firstname3 Lastname3 for investing their time in proofreading my thesis.
