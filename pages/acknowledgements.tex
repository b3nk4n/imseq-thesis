I would like to express my sincere thanks to those who offered feedback on the content or made this thesis even possible. Beginning with \textit{Prof. Dr. Daniel Cremers} for his valuable suggestions at the very beginning of my work. Next, my advisor \textit{Philip Häusser} for offering this interesting topic, his continuous support as well as our fruitful discussion at Google Zurich. Furthermore, I would like to acknowledge \textit{PD Dr. habil. Rudolph Triebel} for his tough but outstanding lecture \textit{Machine Learning in Computer Vision} at TUM, which initiated my interest to do a thesis in this field.


Last but not least, I would also like to thank my family for their faith and positive mentality, who waited patiently for me to finish this work. And not forgetting \textit{Nicole Frangi Doetzer}, \textit{Tom Kingdom}, \textit{Stefan Kraus}, \textit{Patrick Mutter}, \textit{Timo Partl}, \textit{Andrej Prescher}, \textit{Manuel Sautermeister} and \textit{Lukas Wöhrl} in terms of investing their time for proofreading this thesis.
